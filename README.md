### The problem
Co-locate oceanographic data by establishing constraints.

### Application example
A user is interested in all the available oceanographic data in a region where an eddy just formed. They provide the geospatial bounds of the region and a temporal range and get an aggregated response of all available data.

### Specific tasks
- [ ] Collect temporal bounds.
- [ ] Collect spatial bounds.
- [ ] _Collect keywords?_
- [ ] Build query url.
- [ ] Do the search.
- [ ] Manage response.

### Existing methods
- The Irish Marine Institute has developed a [keyword search across existing ERDDAP
  servers](https://github.com/IrishMarineInstitute/search-erddaps)
  - [Here is the list of all ERDDAP's they use.](https://github.com/IrishMarineInstitute/search-erddaps/blob/master/erddaps.json)
- OHW18 built a [search interface for one ERDDAP server](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw18_erddap-explorer)
 

### Proposed methods/tools
- Jupyter
- Python
  - [erddapy](https://github.com/ioos/erddapy)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/overview.html)? 
- ?
